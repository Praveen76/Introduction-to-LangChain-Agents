# Introduction to LangChain Agents

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to using LangChain agents. The notebook demonstrates how to implement and utilize various built-in tools, Python agents, Google Search Engine Agent, and how to build your own tools.

## Repository Contents

- `Introduction-to-LangChain-Agents.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that covers the basics of LangChain agents, including setup, usage, and examples.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to understand and use:

- Built-in tools: Wikipedia, llm-math
- Python agent and tools
- Google Search Engine Agent and tool-serpapi
- How to build your own tool

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebook, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Necessary Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt` file)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Introduction-to-LangChain-Agents.git
    cd Introduction-to-LangChain-Agents
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. Open the notebook `Introduction-to-LangChain-Agents.ipynb`.

3. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to learn about and use LangChain agents and tools.

## Notes

- Ensure you have API keys for any external services you plan to use (e.g., Google Search Engine API with SerpAPI).

- The notebook contains various examples and use cases for LangChain agents. Modify the examples as needed to fit your specific requirements.
